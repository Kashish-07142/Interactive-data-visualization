# Interactive-data-visualization

This project analyzes Chicago crime data from 2001 to 2023, leveraging data 
visualization to uncover crime patterns, temporal trends, arrest rates, and the 
nature of domestic incidents. The primary aim was to provide an interactive and 
insightful view of how crimes have evolved over time and what categories 
dominate the criminal landscape. 
The solution uses dashboards to present layered insights including time-of-day 
trends, crime category breakdowns, domestic violence proportions, and arrest 
effectiveness. Through this approach, the project not only enhances 
understanding of the city's safety concerns but also enables data-driven 
storytelling for stakeholders in policy, law enforcement, and urban 
development.
